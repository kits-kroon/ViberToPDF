# ViberToPDF
A viber .csv back up to PDF converter / printer

The intention of this program is to convert Viber's .csv backup files into a readable PDF using the .NET Framework and C#. It utilises the printing abilities of the .NET framework and will give the user the choice of either printing the information or creating a PDF from there.

There are currently some bugs with the way lines are printed, occasionally a line may be cut off or an extra newline character entered.
